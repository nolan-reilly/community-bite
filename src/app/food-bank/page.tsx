              Welcome to Community Bite, a platform dedicated to tackling hunger
              and food waste. We connect food donors, food banks, and charitable
              organizations to create an efficient and accessible system for
              food distribution.
              <br></br> <br></br>
              Our goal is to ensure that surplus food reaches individuals and
              families in need, reducing waste and strengthening our
              communities.
              <br></br>Join us in making a real difference â€“ shop, donate,
              volunteer, or learn more about how you can help.
              <br></br> <br></br>
              We believe that by working together, we can create a sustainable
              and hunger-free world.
